  <h1>Welcome to London</h1>
  <h3>The centre of the human world</h3>
  <img src="" />
  <p>London is an incredible city to visit and explore, offering a unique blend of rich history and modern vibrancy. As the capital of the world, it boasts iconic landmarks like Big Ben, the London Eye, and Tower Bridge, which I never tire of seeing.</p>

  <h2>LONDON EYE</h2>
  <img src="" />
  <p>The London Eye is a giant observation wheel located on the South Bank of the River Thames. Standing at 135 meters tall, it offers stunning views of London's skyline, including landmarks like Big Ben, St. Paul's Cathedral, and Tower Bridge. Opened in 2000, it's now one of the city's most iconic attractions, providing visitors with a 30-minute ride in spacious glass capsules for a panoramic experience.</p>

  <h2>Greenwich Observatory</h2>
  <img src="" />
  <p>The Royal Observatory Greenwich, established in 1675, is famous for its role in the history of astronomy and navigation. It’s the location of the Prime Meridian, the zero degrees longitude line that divides the eastern and western hemispheres. Visitors can explore its historic telescopes, learn about timekeeping, and enjoy stunning views of London from the observatory grounds. </p>
  <h3>But Who Cares About that!</h3> <p>What I like about the Royal Observatory Greenwich also hosts the Planetarium, where visitors can enjoy immersive shows that explore various astronomical phenomena. The shows feature stunning visuals and fascinating narratives about the universe, stars, and planets. You can see everything from the formation of galaxies to the night sky over London, enhancing the overall visit to this historic site!</p>

            <article>
                <h3>HELLO WORLD</h3>
                <p>I have a growing passion for software and IT. Recently, I completed a course focusing on Microsoft 365 tools, with a particular interest in Excel and PowerPoint. I am actively learning programming and coding to build my skills in the field of IT, with Bright Network and CodeOp being my starting point. Other hobbies that I indulge in is chess. I love the strategic thinking the game involves and how hard it is. I do sports like table tennis and boxing as they are tiring. I aim to continuously improve and explore new areas of technology as I pursue a career in the software and IT industry. It's not a very unique story but one where I will continue to improve on. Sorry if you expected me to be a hero or something hahaha!</p>
